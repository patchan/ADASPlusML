# ADASPlusML

Python script for training a multiple linear regression machine learning model to predict the scoring of the ADAS-Cog Plus assessment. ADASPlusML uses [`Scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org) for machine learning and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data processing.

The components of the ADAS-Cog Plus used to train the model are the ADAS-Cog Total Score, Trail Making Test Score, Verbal Fluency (Animal), Verbal Fluency (Vegetable), and Digit Symbol Substition Test (DSST) Score.

The data used to train the model is used with permission from the [UBC Aging, Mobility, and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://cogmob.rehab.med.ubc.ca). The data is confidential and not provided.
